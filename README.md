# RosettaCMAntibodyBenchmark
The files in this repository represent the source code used to test RosettaAntibody, AbPredict, and several different ROsettaCM-based antibody homology modeling protocols. Each folder represents a different antibody modeled in the benchmark and in them contains the top models produced by each method tested. To replicate these results, download all the scripts in the repository and modify the scripts to point to your personal Rosetta path. Then, run downloadsort.py using the PDB ID followed by Heavy chain and light chain identifiers (i.e. downloadsort.py 1ADQ_HL). This generates a directory for the antibody with a slurm file for each method that can be executed on a high performance computing grid to accelerate run times
